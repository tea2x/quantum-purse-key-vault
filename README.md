# Quantum Purse key vault

This module provides a secure authentication interface to manage FIPS205 (formerly SPHINCS+) cryptographic keys for CKB blockchain using Rust and WebAssembly.

###### <u>Feature list</u>:

| Feature               | Details              |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Signature type**    | SPHINCS+             |
| **Store model**       | Indexed DB           |
| **Mnemonic standard** | Custom BIP39 English |
| **Local encryption**  | AES256               |
| **Key derivation**    | HKDF                 |
| **Authentication**    | Password             |
| **Password hashing**  | Scrypt               |

### Mnemonic backup format
BIP39 is chosen as the mnemonic backup format due to its user-friendliness and quantum resistance.

SPHINCS+ offers 12 parameter sets, grouped by three security parameters: 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit. These require seeds of 48 bytes, 72 bytes, and 96 bytes respectively used across key generation and signing. As BIP39 supports max 32 bytes so this library introduces a custom(combined) BIP39 mnemonic backup format for each security parameter of SPHINCS+ as below:

|    SPHINCS+ security parameter      |  BIP39 entropy level  |   Word count    |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
|    128 bit ~ 48 bytes ~ 3*16 bytes  |       3*16 bytes      | 3*12 = 36 words |
|    192 bit ~ 72 bytes ~ 3*24 bytes  |       3*24 bytes      | 3*18 = 54 words |
|    256 bit ~ 96 bytes ~ 3*32 bytes  |       3*32 bytes      | 3*24 = 72 words |

###### For example:
- SHA2-256s will require users to back up 72 words of mnemonic phrase.
- SHAKE-192s will require users to back up 54 words of mnemonic phrase.
- SHA2-128f will require users to back up 36 words of mnemonic phrase.

### Key Derivation Function

From the single master seed, quantum-purse-key-vault can derive many child keys using Key Derivation Function(KDF). Pure Hash-based KDF is the top choice for this project. Although using [BIP32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032) carefully (with only hardened key derivation and never generate ECDSA public keys) can satisfy however the benefits of the tricky usage at this point(2025) is unclear. Thus, a fresh start with HKDF seems better because it's simpler - meaning the implementation will be easier to audit.

###### Key Tree:
```
master_seed
   ├─ index 0 → sphincs+ key 1
   ├─ index 1 → sphincs+ key 2
   ├─ index 2 → sphincs+ key 3
   └─ ...
```

###### Derivation Flow:
```
master_seed
     │
     ▼
(seed_part1, seed_part2, seed_part3)
     │
     ├─ HKDF("ckb/quantum-purse/sphincs-plus/", index)
     │
     ▼
(sk_seed, sk_prf, pk_seed)
     │
     ├─ sphincs+_key_gen()
     │
     ▼
(sphincs+ public_key, sphincs+ private_key)
```
