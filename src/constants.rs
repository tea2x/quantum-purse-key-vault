/// First protection layer: For a symetrical encryption practice, the first protection effort SHOULD be the responsibitlity of
/// the higher layer impelementation (Quantum Purse Wallet or any other system using this library) to ensure that the encrypted data
/// is never exposed. It is also the responsibility of the end-users to always lock their device carefully.
///
/// Second protection layer: Should the first protection layer fall in any situation, the encryption itself stands as the last resistance
/// against quantum attacks. It should be strong enough, so that breaking it requires comparable resouce to break the NIST category level 1), 3) and 5).
///
/// This library is aiming for level 1) minimum and let users decide if they want to go beyond that with longer passwords because
/// longer passwords are hard to manage. Letting users choose a pass phrase (similar to bip39 but has clearer patterns) is a good practice
/// but then if the passphrase is too long, it is unclear if we shouldlet users authenticate with the mnemonic seed directly.
///
/// For a reference setup:
///  - Minimum required 20-character passwords alone put us at ~128-bit of security in theory (less in reality because of human factors).
///  - Scrypt with param {log_n = 17, r = 8, p = 1, len 32} make each effort to guess a password even harder for the attacker.
///
/// The theoretical security for this setup, thus starts at level 1) and is not upper limited.
